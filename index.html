### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was one of my favorite labs because that is where we 
    first got to actually try coding for the first time. We learned 
    about github and how to “git clone” and “git push” which we will 
    use everytime we code in this language. I think that overall 
    Lab 1 was essential in teaching us for the other labs to come. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7 was another lab that I really ended up enjoying. In this lab 
    we got to code the game of Blackjack which was awesome. I’ve always 
    loved playing Blackjack so learning the behinds of how it actually 
    works and writing functions to make the game work was personally 
    very interesting and enjoyable. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 was one of my favorite labs because I felt it was related to 
    the real world and we got to code functions with numbers. One of my 
    favorite parts was in part 2 specifically the states.cc file. I enjoyed 
    coding this file because working with actual population density relates 
    to the real world and I found it very interesting learning about loops.
